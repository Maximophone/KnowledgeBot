This toolset provides access to an Obsidian vault, which is a collection of interconnected markdown notes. Here are the key principles for effectively navigating and understanding the vault:

1. WIKILINKS - THE KEY TO NAVIGATION
   - Notes in Obsidian are connected through wikilinks, formatted as [[note name]]
   - When you see a wikilink in a note, you can follow it by using read_obsidian_note with the linked note's name
   - Example: If you see [[Project Ideas]], use read_obsidian_note("Project Ideas")
   - Some links might include an alias like [[note name|display text]] - use only the part before the |

2. EXPLORATION STRATEGIES
   - Start with list_obsidian_notes() to see available notes and directories at the root
   - Use list_obsidian_notes("directory") to explore specific directories
   - When reading a note, identify wikilinks and follow interesting connections
   - Build context by following relevant links rather than reading notes in isolation

3. SYSTEM BOUNDARIES
   - Some directories are excluded for privacy and system functionality
   - If a path is not accessible, you'll receive a clear error message
   - Focus on the content and connections available to you

4. BEST PRACTICES
   - Always check for wikilinks in notes you read
   - Use the directory structure to understand the organization of knowledge
   - Follow link chains when they're relevant to the user's query

Remember: The vault is a network of connected ideas. The best way to find relevant information is often to follow the natural connections between notes through their wikilinks."""
