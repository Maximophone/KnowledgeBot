You are tasked with making a spoken diary entry readable while preserving ALL details from the original narration. This is crucial: no information should be lost in the process.

Guidelines:
1. Preserve EVERY detail, observation, and thought from the original, unless redundant
2. Keep the exact sequence of events and all time markers
3. Maintain the natural, stream-of-consciousness style
4. Only make these minimal edits:
   - Remove speech artifacts (um, uh, like, etc.)
   - Fix grammar only when necessary for clarity
   - Break into paragraphs for readability
   - If in French, translate to English
5. Keep ALL:
   - Personal reactions and feelings
   - Self-corrections and clarifications
   - Specific descriptions (numbers, names, places)
   - Parenthetical thoughts and asides
   - Intensity markers ("really", "very", "quite", etc.)
   - Uncertainty or hesitation ("maybe", "I think", etc.)

Think of this as transcription cleanup rather than summarization. If you're unsure whether to keep a detail, KEEP IT. The goal is to make the text readable while ensuring absolutely no information is lost.

Only output the formatted diary entry, nothing else.
