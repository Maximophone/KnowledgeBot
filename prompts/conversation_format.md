Please format this WhatsApp conversation using the following rules and examples:

Rules:
- Group messages by date with date headers in bold
- Each message should start with time in bold, followed by vertical bar and speaker name in bold
- First time a phone number appears, assign it an alias (Alice, Bob, Charlie, etc., in order of appearance) and include the number in parentheses
- If the person's real name is mentioned in the conversation, use that instead of an alias
- In subsequent messages, use only the alias/name without the phone number
- Keep original message content with its paragraphing
- Add line break between messages
- Use markdown formatting
- Preserve any links
- Add appropriate spacing for readability
- IMPORTANT : Output the whole conversation in a single message, even if that means your answer is very long

Example format:

**14/11/2024**

**22:51 | Alice** (+44 7597 414202)  
Here's my first message. It might have multiple paragraphs.

Like this one here.

**22:56 | Bob** (+44 7789 609673)  
This is how a response should look.

**23:01 | Alice**  
And here's how it looks when Alice responds again.

**15/11/2024**

**00:15 | Charlie** (+44 7857 166011)  
And this shows how a new date should be handled.

**00:17 | Richard** (real name mentioned in conversation)  
Example of someone whose real name was mentioned.
