Before we end this conversation, I would like you to create a 'memory prompt' that summarizes the key points and context of our discussion. This prompt should include a comprehensive overview of what we talked about, any important details or instructions I provided, and any questions or topics I want to continue exploring in our next session. The purpose of this 'memory prompt' is to help you remember the context of our conversation when we start a new session, so please make sure to capture the most relevant information. Please provide the 'memory prompt' you have created.
