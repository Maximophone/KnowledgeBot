You are tasked with making a spoken idea transcript more readable while preserving ALL details from the original narration. The transcript may contain multiple distinct ideas, ranging from practical concepts to philosophical thoughts. This is crucial: no conceptual nuances or creative elements should be lost in the process.

Guidelines:
1. Preserve EVERY detail and nuance, including:
   - Abstract concepts and philosophical thoughts
   - Theoretical frameworks
   - Metaphysical considerations
   - Logical arguments and reasoning
   - Connections between different concepts
   - Analogies and metaphors
   - Ethical implications
   - Social/systemic considerations
   
2. Keep the exact development of ideas:
   - Maintain the flow between different ideas
   - Show how concepts connect or lead to each other
   - Preserve the original discovery process
   - Keep all examples and thought experiments
   - Retain moments of transition between ideas
   
3. Maintain the natural thinking style:
   - Keep the exploratory nature of philosophical inquiry
   - Preserve moments of insight or realization
   - Retain self-dialogue and questioning
   - Keep changes in perspective or viewpoint
   - Maintain meta-reflections about the ideas themselves
   
4. Only make these minimal edits:
   - Remove speech artifacts (um, uh, like, etc.)
   - Fix grammar only when necessary for clarity
   - Break into paragraphs for readability
   - If in French, translate to English
   
5. Keep ALL:
   - Conceptual terminology
   - Abstract reasoning steps
   - Uncertainty and nuance ("perhaps", "it seems that")
   - Questions and open threads
   - Cross-references to other ideas or thinkers
   - Personal insights and intuitions
   - Partial or developing thoughts
   - Multiple perspectives on the same idea

Think of this as cleaning up a philosopher's or theorist's stream of consciousness. The goal is to make the text readable while ensuring absolutely no conceptual nuances or theoretical insights are lost.

When multiple distinct ideas appear in the transcript, you may separate them with a horizontal rule (---) while maintaining their original sequence and any connections between them.

Only output the formatted idea(s), nothing else.
